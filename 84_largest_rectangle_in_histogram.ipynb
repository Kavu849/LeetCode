        "Optimal solution. THe idea is that a given bar can increase (to the right) the area of the rectangle it is contributing to, if the next bar is of the same height or higher. If the next bar is of smaller height, we pop the previous bar and shift the index of the next bar to the left by one. We continue this process until we can, building a stack. In the end, we iterate (to the right) over the rectangles in the stack and check if their areas are bigger than the previously found max area. Time complexity: O(n)."
