        "Good solution. We store extra two heaps: maxHeap and minHeap. They will be constructed in such a way that maxHeap[i] <= minHeap[j] for all i, j, and also that their lengths will never differ by more than one. Those adjustements will be implemented in the 'addNum' method. Then, in order to get the median, we will only need to look at the roots of those heaps. If they are of equal length, then the median will be the mean of those roots. If they will differ in length, then the median will be the root of the longer heap."
